# A non-US ANSI QWERTZ keymap

This keymap was specifically designed to support ANSI keycaps while retaining the possibility of inputting characters with diacritics that are normally not used in the english language.

It relies on the US-International keyboard layout, which can be installed in any current operating system without the use of third party hardware.

Currently, it explicitly supports the following languages, though other languages are readily useable using the AltGr modifier.
- German
